As a response to the constant pull technology has on my, and most people I know, life I want to construct a globe that shows secluded parts of the world. Right now I’m calling this project the Nowhere Map, but that’s really just a placeholder.  Hopefully as I process my ideas, and as the project continues to take shape, I will come up with a better name.

Why a globe?  I want my response to how technology has hijacked my life to be a tangible, screen-less solution.  I want the user to be able to pick up the globe and imagine what it is like on the unrecognizable blobs of land that remain.   So for me and this project, 3-D all the way!  
  
Here is a quick prototype of what I imagine it will look like:
