I’ve refined my initial idea and changed my project’s title from nowhere map (which was never an appropriate title) to Deserted Islands, World Globe. I’ve come to think of my data, of lack of, as little islands.  What makes up these “islands” are areas that I consider to be remote locations that represents solitude.  I have come up with some parameters of what seclusion means to me: no people, no power, and no Internet.  I’m sure I could come up with many other factors, and I have, but for this project I’m sticking to those basic three elements.
