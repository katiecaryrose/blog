I spent a GREAT deal of my day with the TROTEC Speedy 300.  Of course there were many students wanting to use the laser cutter for their finals projects, so I spent a few hours waiting around for my turn.  After all this waiting, the tech asked me if I could come back at 7pm, apparently the laser cutter was acting up and had even caught fire a couple times.  “Fine”, I said.  At 7pm sharp I started cutting with help form the lovely tech Amanda.  We started with the 1/2 “ plexi glass, which was used for the globe’s stand.  Amanda helped with the settings and then we started cutting. Immediately the plexi caught on fire.  The fire was small and stopped the second we canceled the job, but it was terrifying.  Especially since I only had one piece of $$$ plexi and this was my last chance to use the laser cutter.  We salvaged the plexi, and we were able to reorient my template to account for where the plexi caught fire.  Second try we removed the protective coating from the plexi: no fire.  Success!

Although the small fire was nerve racking, it was nothing compared to the headache of etching and cutting the globe template out of 4-ply Bristol board.  Because I used .pngs for the landmasses it created all sorts of issues for my files.  Without getting into too many tedious details I’ll just say it caused two main issues: I had to create seperate jobs to engrave and then to cut, which then created registering complications.  After using all the paper I had, and 4 hours later, the end result was (the East).

Amanda and I also played with the settings. I now see the laser cutter process for what it is: a systematic trial and error process.  And now I know better!

I have the hardest time keeping myself from spelling lasers as LAZERS.  LAZERS just looks cooler.
