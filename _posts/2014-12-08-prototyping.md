I came up with a basic design for the globe’s stand.  I wanted the design to be simple yet untraditional.  KJ and I were looking globes on the Internet a few weeks ago and we saw a similar stand to the one I have designed below.  Honestly, I don’t remember what the original stand looked like, but whatever I do remember served as inspiration for this design.  I kept it simple and I like it!
