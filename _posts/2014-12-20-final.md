After spending my entire Sunday night with the laser cutter, I didn’t even consider putting the newly cut pieces together until the following morning.  Luckily, because of the simple design and lap joint of the stand, I was able to set up the stand in no time.   Before I cut out the stand, one of the techs recommended that I make a small prototype of just the lap joint of the stand to be sure that it fit snuggly.  He also recommended that I alter the measurement of the joint a bit to account for the 1/64 inch space that the laser detracts to make the cut.

The prototype worked so I was able to safely cut out the stand.  Besides the fire, the pieces cut out perfectly.

Assembling the actual globe wasn’t hard but tedious.  The map was cut out of 4-ply Bristol board and I used an archival version of PVA glue, Jade, to adhere the gores of the map to one another.   Generally, I’m happy with the result but I would like to experiment with another material in the future and possibly a different adhesive depending on the new material.
