I defined my map to be secluded landmasses that have no people, power, or Internet.   I’m in no way gathering this data in any official manner.  In fact, I’m purely finding maps that individually represent my three main elements and then rendering them to one map that I will then fit to my map template.  

First, I took maps that express the data that I don’t want to show on my map.

Then I isolated the data.

And then I overlaid the three different data on top of one another to get the data that I will eliminate to form my final map.
